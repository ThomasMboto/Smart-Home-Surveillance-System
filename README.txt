The .pdf file covers part (a) and (b) of the assignment - it includes my sketches and prototype storyboards.\

If you have Xcode installed on your computer, executing the program will be easy - as I\'92m sure you already know how to. Below are steps:\
\
	i) 	unzip smart.zip\
	ii)	Once in the folder, double click the \'91smart.xcodeproj\'92 file\
	iii)	Once Xcode has loaded, press command(
\f1 \uc0\u8984 )+R keys\
	\
	iv) 	if the UI does not load  - as in the iPhone simulator remains black, do the 		following:	\
			i)click on the simulator\
			ii)navigate to the top-left-most part of your screen. \
			iii)Beside the apple logo, click on the iOS Simulator drop down list\
			iv)Select to \'91Reset Content and Settings\'85\'92\
			v)Now if you go back to the project and run it, the simulator should work.\
\
If  you don\'92t have Xcode on the other hand\'85..the school\'92s Macs have it installed.  And, hopefully I don\'92t lose marks for the inconvenience.}
