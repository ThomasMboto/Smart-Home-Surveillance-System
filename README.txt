# README.txt

The .pdf file covers part (a) and (b) of the assignment - it includes my sketches and prototype storyboards.

If you have Xcode installed on your computer, executing the program will be easy - as I\'92m sure you already know how to. Below are steps:

	i) 	unzip smart.zip
	ii)	Once in the folder, double click the 'smart.xcodeproj' file
	iii)	Once Xcode has loaded, press command+R keys
	iv) 	if the UI does not load  - as in the iPhone simulator remains black, do the following:	
			i)click on the simulator
			ii)navigate to the top-left-most part of your screen. 
			iii)Beside the apple logo, click on the iOS Simulator drop down list
			iv)Select to 'Reset Content and Settings'
			v)Now if you go back to the project and run it, the simulator should work.
			
If  you don't have Xcode on your Mac, you'll have to install it - there is no way around it.
